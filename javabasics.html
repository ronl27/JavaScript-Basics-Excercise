      <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <li> <a href="Variable Declaration">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span> </li>
      <li> <a href="Variable Assignment">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span> var x =10; </span> </li>
      <li> <a href="Data Types">Data Type</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span> false; </span> null <span> null</span> aka nothing; Number -<span>42</span> or <span> 3.14159;</span> String -<span>”Coding Dojo Rocks!”;</span>Array - <span>[1, ‘Coding’, 2, ‘Dojo’];</span> and Object - <span> {first_name: ‘Jane’, last_name: ‘Doe’}</span> </li>
      <li> <a href="Conditionals">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span> if </span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span> else if </span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span> else </span> we execute this block of code;</li>
      <li> <a href="Loops">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That’s a loop! </li>
